"""
You are given two arrays of integers a and b, and two integers lower and upper. Your task is to find the number of pairs (i, j) such that lower ≤ a[i] * a[i] + b[j] * b[j] ≤ upper.

Example

For a = [3, -1, 9], b = [100, 5, -2], lower = 7, and upper = 99, the output should be boundedSquareSum(a, b, lower, upper) = 4.

There are only four pairs that satisfy the requirement:

If i = 0 and j = 1, then a[0] = 3, b[1] = 5, and 7 ≤ 3 * 3 + 5 * 5 = 9 + 25 = 36 ≤ 99.
If i = 0 and j = 2, then a[0] = 3, b[2] = -2, and 7 ≤ 3 * 3 + (-2) * (-2) = 9 + 4 = 13 ≤ 99.
If i = 1 and j = 1, then a[1] = -1, b[1] = 5, and 7 ≤ (-1) * (-1) + 5 * 5 = 1 + 25 = 26 ≤ 99.
If i = 2 and j = 2, then a[2] = 9, b[2] = -2, and 7 ≤ 9 * 9 + (-2) * (-2) = 81 + 4 = 85 ≤ 99.
For a = [1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3], b = [10], lower = 0, and upper = 100, the output should be boundedSquareSum(a, b, lower, upper) = 0.

Since the array b contains only one element 10 and the array a does not contain 0, it is not possible to satisfy 0 ≤ a[i] * a[i] + 10 * 10 ≤ 100.

Input/Output

[input] array.integer b

A second array of integers.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ b.length ≤ 105,
-104 ≤ b[i] ≤ 104.

[input] integer lower

An integer representing a lower bound of a satisfiable square sum.

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ lower ≤ 109.

[input] integer upper

An integer representing an upper bound of a satisfiable square sum.

Guaranteed constraints:
lower ≤ upper,
0 ≤ upper ≤ 109.

[output] integer

The number of pairs (i, j) such, that lower ≤ a[i] * a[i] + b[j] * b[j] ≤ upper. It is guaranteed that the answer fits in 32-bit value type.
